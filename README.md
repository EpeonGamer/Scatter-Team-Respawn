# Scatter Team Respawn
 Minecraft datapack, respawn next to team, with functionality to be scattered far from spawn.

## Current supported versions:
- 1.20.1

## Recommended mods (note required):
- Any that add more structures and increase their frequency somewhat (makes exploration after scatter more engaging)
